////////////////////////// Feature Requests ///////////////////////////

APPROVED:
[ ] Static Texture Nodes
[ ] Mouse Input Uniform
[ ] Input Texture Keyboard
[ ] Channel resolution uniforms
[ ] Create user documentation

DECISION NEEDED:
[ ] FragCoordUV (0-1) vs FragCoord (0-iResolution)

PENDING:
[ ] Detects if inputs "dirty" before rendering a renderlayer
[ ] Configure Texture filtering modes for renderlayer output textures.
[ ] Graph Editor
[ ] Proper shutdown sequence?
[ ] Reload TAR file without restarting?
[ ] Output node that controls game state (pause, play, quit, fullscreen, save, load etc.)
[ ] Output node that controls sounds (somehow?)

META:
[ ] Upload to github?
[ ] Strip the binary to reduce filesize in build system?
[ ] Build on CI (arrgh! No!!!)
[ ] Build/Test on Windows
